![](floating_lidar_photo_IWES.jpg)

RP18 was produced by members of [IEA Wind Task 32](http://community.ieawind.org/task32/) and incorporates the Offshore Wind Accelerator's _Recommended Practice for floating lidar systems_<sup>[1](#CTRM)</sup>, which is the result of a cooperation of an IEA Wind TCP Task 32 expert group and the Offshore Wind Accelerator initiative. 

# Version 1.0
The first version of RP 18 was released in September 2017. It is [included in this repository as the 1.0 release](./../../releases/tag/1.0).

# How to provide feedback to the Recommended Practice
There are two ways to provide feedback to RP18.

## Through Github
You can provide feedback to RP 18 by [raising an issue](https://github.com/IEA-Wind-Task-32/RP18-floating-lidar-systems/issues). Before you raise an issue, please take a few minutes to check if there is a similar one in the list already.

**You will have to be logged in to Github to provide feedback**. This means that your feedback will be associated with your username, which may make it possible to identify you. We prefer to have feedback associated with a name because RP18 is a community document.
