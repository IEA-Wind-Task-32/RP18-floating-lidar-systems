This is a repository for the IEA Wind Recommended Practice 18 (RP 18) on Floating Lidar Systems.

![](floating_lidar_photo_IWES.jpeg)

RP18 was produced by members of [IEA Wind Task 32](http://community.ieawind.org/task32/) and incorporates the Offshore Wind Accelerator's _Recommended Practice for floating lidar systems_<sup>[1](#CTRM)</sup>, which is the result of a cooperation of an IEA Wind TCP Task 32 expert group and the Offshore Wind Accelerator initiative. 

# Version 1.0
The first version of RP 18 was released in September 2017.

# How to provide feedback to the Recommended Practice
There are two ways to provide feedback to RP18.

## Through Github
You can provide feedback to RP 18 by [raising an issue](https://github.com/IEA-Wind-Task-32/RP18-floating-lidar-systems/issues). Before you raise an issue, please take a few minutes to check if there is a similar one in the list already.

**You will have to be logged in to Github to provide feedback**. This means that your feedback will be associated with your username, which may make it possible to identify you. We prefer to have feedback associated with a name because RP18 is a community document.

## Via the IEA Wind Task 32 Operating Agent
Please send your feedback to [ieawind.task32@ifb.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:ieawind.task32@ifb.uni-stuttgart.de). Please note that your email may be forwarded in its entirety to the rest of the author team. If you need anonymity, please indicate this in your email. Your email should include:
- **Section** What section of RP18 does this feedback apply to?
